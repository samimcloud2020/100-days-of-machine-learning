Rescales values to a range between 0 and 1	                             Centers data around the mean and scales to a standard deviation of 1
Useful when the distribution of the data is unknown or not Gaussian	     Useful when the distribution of the data is Gaussian or unknown
Sensitive to outliers	                                                   Less sensitive to outliers
Retains the shape of the original distribution	                         Changes the shape of the original distribution
May not preserve the relationships between the data points	             Preserves the relationships between the data points
Equation: (x – min)/(max – min)	                                         Equation: (x – mean)/standard deviation


NOTE:
It is a good practice to fit the scaler on the training data and then use it to transform the testing data.
This would avoid any data leakage during the model testing process. 
Also, the scaling of target values is generally not required.
